# GVJCI Hugo

Testing out Hugo with Netlify CMS

## Commands

- `hugo server -D` = Start development server

## Notes

- There is something called "Wufoo" forms being used (connected to SurveyMonkey). May need to look into payment processing with something like Stripe since they do have a nonprofit pricing opportunity
- Search would need to be handled by something like Algolia
